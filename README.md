I wanted to make this for a while and when I stumbled upon a [Barrel Distortion](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wtBXRz) shader in shadertoy I got the nudge I needed to start this. 
After a bit of research on old CRT and their physics, plus having lived with them for a while I decided on the components of the shader.

I want:
1. the picture to seem interlaced
2. the interlacing to appear like its slightly moving, which is more pronounced through a good camera
3. the signal to be noisy
4. part of the noise to be like "strokes" simulating cosmic radiation charge particles hitting the phosporous
5. the screen of the CRT to be distorted realistically
6. all shader parameters to be controllable

Added some vignette to hide the edge of distortions to make a smoother result.
